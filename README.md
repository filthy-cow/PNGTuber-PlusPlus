##Per kaiakairos (original author)
This is a Godot 4.1.2 stable project. Not sure if everything will work in future version.
This code is very bad so be warned this is a SLOP project

## Per filthy-cow (developer of this fork)
The purpose of this fork is to add some Quality of Life features on top of the original!  I'll do my best to keep a list of notable changes here!

###Quality of Life Changes so far:
- Jul 2 2025: Smaller zoom increment (2.5% instead of 10% per scroll tick)
